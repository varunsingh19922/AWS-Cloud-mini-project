This is a mini project where I designed the backend architecture of a popular party game Assassins. The design requirements posed many challenges due to the functionalities outlined. With projected users in the millions across hundreds of thousands of games, key features such as matchmaking, mobile interactivity, messaging, and support for up to 20 players per game were seamlessly integrated. Through effective use of AWS services like Cognito, SQS, and GameLift, the architecture ensures scalability, responsiveness, and reliability crucial for a smooth gaming experience. The backend's design was validated through various use cases and a robust set of software "ilities" including scalability, responsiveness, redundancy, reliability, and adaptability were meticulously addressed. Potential failures were also considered and mitigated, such as addressing latency issues through ping matching and ensuring data integrity with regular backups. By leveraging AWS services and adhering to best practices, the backend architecture promises a high-quality gaming experience for users.
